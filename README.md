# Dependency-track gradle plugin

This is a community plugin that helps you with bom publication to your Dependency-Track server.

> :warning: **This plugin does not generate the bom itself**

### Using the plugin

We choose [cycloneDx plugin](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gradle-plugin) to generate the bom.

In the target project, add the plugins as usual:
```
plugins {
    id "org.cyclonedx.bom" version "1.4.1"
    id 'dependency-track' version "0.1.0"
}
```

Configure your custom properties:

```
dependencyTrack {
    host = 'your-dtrack-server-host'
    apiKey = 'your-dtrack-api-key'
    projectName = 'your-project-name'   //optional
    projectVersion = 'your-project-version'   //optional
}
tasks.named('dependencyTrack') {
    dependsOn cyclonedxBom
}
```

Run with:
```
./gradlew dependencyTrack -i
